# The Challenge

A non governmental organization called WorldWater asked me to create a **minimum viable product**for a website that was suitable for mobile.
The organization's goal for this project is to increase financial and community support for users of the site in it's English speaking markets. The design I created was the result of an iterative research and design process.

<!-- It was the first project
where I handled mobile app design, and I was very excited to learn the
intricacies of the iOS platform. -->

<!-- My clients John and Kat have done some preliminary interviews
with psychologists and psychiatrists to get their side of the picture.
They have established a user persona, a business model canvas, and
several startup prep work for the product to take off. My job was to
actually create the experience for their users and make sure they are
represented in the design process. -->

 

# Research
## Survey
A screener survey was completed with participants who reported that they had been involved with NGO’s as a supporter or volunteer in the last twelve months. 

## Interview
Interviews were conducted with a representative group of users.

# Discovery: Personas and Empathy Maps
Based on these interviews 2 primary personas of users emerged. 

## Personas
The first persona, Linda, valued personal connection as a factor related to her involvement with organizations. Linda was generous with her time and was not a frequent user of mobile apps.
![Persona Linda](/PersonaLinda.jpg "Lean Persona Linda")

The second persona, Shawn, valued personal connection as well. Shawn had less time to give and appreciated convenience as factor in websites and apps.
![Persona Shawn](/PersonaShawn.jpg "Lean Persona Shawn")

## Empathy Maps
Empathy maps were developed to gain a more detailed view of each persona's behaviors and motivations.

# Content Strategy: Card Sort and Site Map


## Card Sort
With the user personas in mind, A card sort activity was engaged to evaluate how users would categorize information on a website. This activity evaluates the website’s content strategy by asking participants in a study to sort cards with tasks associated with the website into categories that make sense to the user. The results of the study including the categories, cards, and participant comments (during moderated sessions) are analyzed and evaluated. 

![Card Sort Report Cover](/MedWaterCardSortReportV1_Page_1.jpg "Card Sort Report Cover")

The following similarity matrix (representing the combined participants) compares two cards and scores them based on how many participants agreed with the pair. Darker/higher numbers signify a stronger relationship between the card above the number and the card to the right of the number.  

![Card Sort Similarity Index](/MedWaterCardSortSimilarityMatrixFinal.png "Site Map High Fidelity")



## Site Map
Informed by the categories that users selected during the card sort activity a site map was developed based on the results of the study. 

![Site Map Low Fidelity](/MwSiteMapLoFi.jpg "Site Map Low Fidelity")

Additional review the results resulted in a second iteration of the site map.

## Design and Iteration
Based on the results of the research and discovery activities described above, some flows for typical user processes began to emerge.

## User Flows
Sketches were made of the most fundamental processes of the site, including this example of a user flow from the landing page to the creation of a user account.

![User Flow Low Fidelity](/UserFlowLoFi_Page_2.jpg "User Flow Low Fidelity") *User flow sketch: Landing Page to Create Account*

Based on these sketches and additional study of the research material, higher fidelity renderings of the user flows were completed.

![User Flow High Fidelity](/MedWaterUserFlowsHiFi_Page_2.jpg "User Flow High Fidelity 2") *User flow high fidelity: Landing Page to Donation*

## Sketching
With a clearer sense of how a user might interact with the site, some initial sketches could be made. Here are early sketches of screen flows from the Landing Page to creating an Account.

![Sketch: Landing Page to Login2](/01MWLandingPagetoLogin_Page_2.jpg "Landing Page to Login 2") *Screen design sketch: Landing Page to Create Account 2*

## Wireframing
Based on user feedback on sketches a low fidelity wire frame was developed. This wire frame is an rendering of the Landing Page to Donation user flow.

![Wire Frame 2](/LandingPgToDonate2.png "Wire Frame: Landing Page to Login 2") 

![Wire Frame 3](/LandingPgToDonate3.png "Wire Frame: Landing Page to Login 3") 

![Wire Frame 4](/LandingPgToDonate4.png "Wire Frame: Landing Page to Login 4") 

![Wire Frame 5](/LandingPgToDonate5.png "Wire Frame: Landing Page to Login 5") 

## Style Guide
In preparation for a prototype a [style guide](/MedWaterStyleGuide.pdf) was developed. The style guide reflects the color scheme and font choices and some basic aspects of the user interface. A color palette was selected based on the organization's current color scheme and their emphasis on water. Additional remaining colors reﬂect some of the tones found in the region of Ecuador where the organization's operations are based. The green shades for text reﬂect the mood of growth and optimism that the site coneys.

## Low Fidelity Prototype
A low fidelity clickable [prototype] (/MWMobilePrototype.pdf) was created in Balsamiq. The prototype primarily simulates the login and donation flows.


## Usability Study
Based on the low fidelity prototype, a moderated usability study was completed. Users were asked to complete tasks related to creating an account, making a donation to the organization, and challenges others in a fundraising activity using the mobile site.

# Next Steps

Based on the results of the usability study, an additional iteration of the design and further testing will have the design ready for beta development. 

Additional areas for research and design are related to the updating the organizations blog structure and their use of mapping assets with the organization's partner communities in Ecuador.
