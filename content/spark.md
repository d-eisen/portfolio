# Problem
I was challenged by the executive leadership of my company at the time to develop a new product that would promote diversity and inclusion amongst staff members working in front line positions in long term care facilities. Leaders of the organization were concerned about staff engagement and service delivery in a region  with high levels of racial, ethnic, and economic diversity.

# Solution
In partnership with a design consultant and a visual designer we developed a facilitator led training course that incorporates empathy building, diversity and inclusion through gamification and interpersonal interaction. The program is structured in five free standing training modules and can be delivered directly in staff members working environment. Modules last fifteen minutes each. Each module is designed from the perspective of healthcare workers and encourages discussion and storytelling. Program assets including facilitator guide, learner guide, and game board.

# User Research
I performed primary research with managers and front line staff at a few different facilities to learn more about the needs of the staff as end users. Partnering with the executive team, I obtained the business requirements for the project, including the budget. The learning department was consulted on what type of training may be most effective with front line staff. Secondary research was performed including resources previously developed by the company.

# Insights
Based on my interviews with staff members, some of the most frequent pain points were related to misunderstandings and miscommunications between staff members. "We all work two jobs and we don't have time to get to know one another. 
![Spark PullQuote](/spark/img/SparkPullQuoteV5.png "Spark Pull Quote")

# Design
A design session was convened with the consultant, learning team, and executive sponsor. Insights from my interviews with staff were shared. From this session the following requirements emerged:
<ul>Connect teaching points on diversity and inclusion with the organization's current service values</ul>
<ul>Training should be instructor led and delivered in the staff work area</ul>

Other design requirements were clarified:
<ul>Modular free standing design to allow for users to join anywhere in the sequence</ul>
<ul> Gamification for quick engagement</ul>
<ul>Simple materials that are easily reproducible</ul>

# Develop
An initial draft of the facilitator guide, learner guide, and game board were developed.
Drafts were circulated for feedback and markup by all stakeholder groups. 

# Iterate
A final prototype was developed for testing. I convened a user testing session in one of the target facilities. A full test of the materials was completed using a sample facilitator and group of participants. The design consultants and I captured user feedback on the materials.

Based on the user sessions, adjustments were made to the curriculum based on user feedback. Specific changes were: 
<ul>Facilitators would like to have sample images available for assisting the participants in their group project</ul>
<ul>Participants indicated that they would like more time to talk with one another during the session.</ul> 

# Next Steps
The executive leadership were pleased with the final product and assumed responsibility for its implemenation in the field.  

# Suggestions for further development
Diversity and inclusion principles should be integrated with services values and incorporated into new staff training. This project revealed important gaps in the sample facility's processes related to multiple language access. Steps have been taken to address these issues by the leadership but may warrant further review.
