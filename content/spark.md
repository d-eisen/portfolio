# Problem
I was challenged by the executive leadership of my company at the time to develop a new product that would promote diversity and inclusion amongst staff members working in front line positions in long term care facilities.

# Solution
In partnership with a design consultant and a visual designer we developed a facilitator led training training course that incorporates empathy building, diversity, and inclusion through gamification and interpersonal interaction. The program is structured in five free standing training modules and can be delivered directly in staff members working environment. Modules last fifteen minutes each. Each module is designed from the perspective of healthcare workers and encourages discussion and storytelling. Program assets including facilitator guide, learner guide, and game board.

# Research
I performed primary research with chaplains and front line staff to learn more about the needs of the staff.

Business requirements were obtained from executive team.

The learning department was consulted on what type of training in most effective with front line staff

Secondary research related to previous diversity efforts was reviewed.

# Discover
Insights include: heartburns related to misunderstanding and miscommunication between staff.

A profile of a female CNA from Cuba was developed as we designed

# Design
Based on a framework of current service values, themes related to diversity and inclusion were incorporated into the module

A design session was held where insights from interviews were shared.

The following design decisions were made informed by research and discovery. 
Instructor led training
Delivered on the floor
Modular free standing design, 
Gamification 
Simple materials
# Develop
An initial draft of the facilitator guide, learner guide, and game board were developed.
Drafts were iterated on with input from team members and front line staff.

# Iterate
A final prototype was developed for testing.
Visual designers, a sample facilitator and participants were convened for a user testing session.

Users suggested tweaks to the content. 
Changes were made.

# Next Steps
Diversity and inclusion incorporated into new staff training. 

# Insights
Tying the module to the service values allowed the product to have greater longevity.
