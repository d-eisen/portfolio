# The Design Challenge

The committee to elect Jim Haadsma wanted a new website for Jim’s upcoming campaign for re-election to the Michigan State House of Representatives, 62nd District. The client was interested in a site the presented a professional and inviting look that emphasized Jim’s strengths as a candidate. The client also wanted to make available a full set of campaign tools including a donation form and volunteer sign up.

# Users and Audience

The primary audience for the site are voters in the 62nd Congressional District of Michigan which includes the cities of Battle Creek and Albion. Our primary audience of users to the site were potential volunteers, donors, or voters. A secondary user audience was the client, mainly campaign staff who would be updating the site after delivery.

# Roles and Responsibilities
I served as the Designer for the site leveraging my skills in user experience design and visual design.
# Scope and Constraints

One of the objectives of the project was to deliver a site that would allow for busy staff to update the site quickly and easily throughout the campaign. In order to accomplish this, the team utilized a WordPress template that added minimal complexity to the existing WordPress content management system. As a designer, I had to work within the design capabilities of the content management system that we would be delivering to the client.  
# Process

The team lead collected very detailed requirements from the campaign. In a kickoff meeting with the campaign, we heard from the candidate himself and asked follow up questions of the campaign.
I began wireframing with paper and ink and moved quickly to a mockup using Sketch. I uploaded the mockup into InVision for a clickable prototype in InVision. From there, the campaign and all team members made two rounds of edits collected by comments on the prototype. We moved to the development site from there, and the engineer took the lead in developing the site. I partnered with the engineer, interpreting design specs and making edits in CSS.

One of the client’s strengths as a candidate is his connection and credibility in the local community. 
On the legislative Priorities page, I set each of the candidate’s five individual priority areas in context with images of the candidate that include people in the community.

The updated Get Involved interface includes a clear call to action supported by buttons for making a donation as well as a form to contact the candidate’s office.

# Outcomes and Lessons

One of the strengths of the site is the way in which the photographs tell a clear story about the candidate. Working with such great images of the candidate meant that my role as the designer was to keep the UI and other design elements in balance with these images. Knowing that the site we ship must put a minimal burden on the staff to update meant utilizing a minimal plugin structure as the site was developed. Futhermore respecting the tight timeline and a smooth development process meant designing with the constraints of the development technology in mind. The campaign staff reported being quite pleased with the staff. The site is live and has been celebrated with a kickoff event.
